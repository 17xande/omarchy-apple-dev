# device-run.sh --lldb, one command, breakpoint hit, 2026-10-07

Host jw16 (Arch Linux aarch64), iPhone 15 Pro Max (iPhone16,2) iOS 27.0.1 (24A446) through the
Studio Display hub, Swift 6.4.0 swift.org toolchain, xtool f0a1f90. Started 13:46Z with
`LLDB_CMDS` holding the five LLDB commands below; the app is the `xtool new` template (UO).

```
$ LLDB_PYTHONHOME=<cpython 3.12> LLDB_CMDS=<commands> device-run.sh --lldb

```

The DDI mount, the RSD tunnel, the phone's Swift runtime (copied once, 6.9 GB, reused) and the
sysroot all came from the script. Full transcript: `session.txt` next to this note on esper at
`~/tmp/apple-dev/jw16-lldb-proof/`. `thread backtrace 5` printed only the idle worker thread
(thread #5 is the selected thread after the stop; the stop was on thread #1).
